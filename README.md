# Agency Problem and Natural Experiment â€“ Corporate Finance Analysis

This project investigates the agency problem in corporate finance by analyzing the effects of a natural experiment on firm governance behavior. Developed for a graduate-level Topics in Corporate Finance course at HEC MontrÃ©al, the notebook replicates and extends empirical findings from the academic literature using panel data regression.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This analysis explores whether changes in external conditionsâ€”such as regulatory or policy shocksâ€”affect corporate decision-making and managerial behavior, particularly in the context of the **agency problem**. Using firm-level panel data, the project constructs treatment and control groups to estimate the causal impact of the natural experiment on variables such as:

- CEO duality (CEO also serving as board chair)
- Board independence
- Firm leverage, size, and financial performance

The workflow includes:

- Reading and cleaning annual financial data
- Constructing key governance indicators
- Winsorizing and transforming relevant variables
- Running **fixed-effects panel regressions** with `PanelOLS` to account for unobserved heterogeneity
- Interpreting coefficients within the framework of agency theory

This project demonstrates how **natural experiments** and **econometric techniques** can be applied to corporate finance to test theoretical predictions and uncover real-world implications.
